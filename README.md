# Deelz Tech Store

## Description
This project was the final capstone project of level 1 in the web developer bootcamp at HyperionDev.

This project expanded on the first capstone project where we built the HTML and CSS part of the store. The last part was to make the site interactive using Javascript and jQuery.

This project allows you to browse an online tech store called Deelz, navigate the various pages, click on products in the catalogue to be taken to the specific product page, where you will be able to see full product specs, add to the cart and view the total in your cart.

## Home

In the home page, you will immediately see some jQuery animations and chained effects come to life. The customised company logo appears in the navbar and as a background image.
The home page describes what you will expect as a customer at Deelz and you will also see some testimonials from delighted customers.

## About Us

You will be met with the same jQuery animation on the H1 header, which aims to grab the customer's attention. This page entails a brief company history and the mission and values of the company.

## Meet The Team

Again, you will see the same attention grabbing H1 animation. On this page, you will be able to see a bit about each of the manager's responsibilities and have access to the names of the various stores managers and their contact details, laid out in a table.

## Catalogue

The catalogue pages also contains the H1 jQuery animation. This page displays 5 different products available for purchase. Each image is embedded in an anchor tag and contains a hover effect, which pops the picture forwards and enlarges it. Clicking on these images will take you to their own HTML pages, where you will be able to view some specs and the price and have the option to add the product to the cart. When you click the add to cart button, you will be met with an alert that tells you the current total of the cart. The same features apply to all of the images in the catalogue.

## Product pages

After clicking on an image from the catalogue, you will be directed to that specific product's information page. You can view the specs and have an option to add the product to the cart.

## Shopping Cart

Inside the shopping cart, you will see your products displayed in the following fashion: product name, individual product price, quantity and product total, based on how many of the same product you have added. At the bottom, you will view a sub-total and then be informed of a VAT addition, and finally, the total shopping price after value added tax. When you click on the "confirm order" button, you should see an alert thanking you for your purchase and a reference number inside the same alert box.

## Installation

If you would like to have a look at the project on your computer, click the green code button and then click the copy to clipboard button to copy the repository for cloning. Then, open your terminal and type git clone and then paste the url. You will then have a local copy. Open in your code editor and run on a live server.

## Usage

This intuative online store is easy to navigate. A navbar sits at the very top of the page and contains links within the page name buttons to navigate you across the site. See points above regarding what to expect on each page. View the screenshots below for a quick tour of the site.
